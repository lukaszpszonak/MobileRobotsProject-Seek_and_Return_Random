# MobileRobotsProject-Seek_and_Return_Random-
A mobile robots project created in Coppelia Sim Edu environment and programmed with Lua. The simulated Pioneer_P3DX mobile robot is tasked with finding a beacon placed somewhere on the map, while a robot starts in the middle of a room place on the mape with only one entry to the room. The robot must leave the room and by moving at random seek the beacon while avoiding the obstacles placed in random places on the map. After the beacon is found the robot must stop for 5 second and then return to the room (the random movement however remains unchanged).
